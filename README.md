# Infinite Giphy

This is a simple web app that displays Giphy search results. A query is either:
* space
* fashion
* techno
* magic
* moon
* burberry

### Guide

* Paste your `GIPHY_KEY` in `.env` file (replacing `***`). I can provide it to you or you can get it by creating a new app on Giphy [website](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true)
* All commands are executed from root directory.
* Prerequisite: **install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**

### Commands

1. Install dependencies: run `npm install`
2. Run the program locally in development mode: `npm start` and open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
3. Build and compile code for staging: `npm run build`. After the command is executed you should be able to see compiled code in `/dest` folder
4. Run tests: `npm run test`
